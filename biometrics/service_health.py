# Pump stall detection. The hub water-temperature sensor sits next to the

# it reads moving water leaving the bed, meaningful. If the pump stalls
# while the TEC keeps drawing current, the sensor reads stagnant water next
# to a powered heating element instead: a runaway number that doesn't
# reflect bed temperature. This exact failure mode was reported by a
# free-sleep user (side ran to 102F against an 84F setpoint overnight,
# cleared by a power cycle) and independently documented by sleepypod/core's
# ADR 0022. Verified against this pod's live frzHealth frames: pump RPM
# running ~1900-2000, TEC current several amps when actively heating/cooling

# direction.
#
# KNOWN WRONG, do not tune these to compensate. This check was built on the
# assumption that TEC current is the "commanded active" signal, so that a
# side which is merely switched off would not look like a stall. Eleven days
# of the per-frame trace say otherwise: rpm reads 0 for exactly the hours the
# power schedule has the side off (0% of frames from 20:00 to 07:00 local,
# ~100% from 08:00 to 19:00), while TEC current never once falls below 7.2A
# in 96,247 frames, so the 1.0A bar never excludes anything. The rule
# therefore reduces to "rpm below 200" and fires every day at power-off.
# No threshold on current can separate on from off, and any dwell short
# enough to catch a real stall is far shorter than the multi-hour normal off
# stretches. The fix is to gate on whether the side is actually powered on;
# see the transition trace below for the data being gathered to do that.
