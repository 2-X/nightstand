# until it is unplugged. Runs every minute from
# free-sleep-network-watchdog.timer, and only where that driver is loaded.
#
# It restarts when the driver crashed this boot and the network has been down
# for 5 minutes, or when the network has been down for 20 minutes and Wi-Fi
# scans failed the whole time. A router that is away while scans still work
# never counts. Nothing happens in the first 10 minutes after boot or while
# an update, rollback, switch, install, reset or biometrics install runs, and
# it restarts at most once in 6 hours and 3 times in 24.
#
# A restart after this crash can hang with PID 1 frozen, so it only
# restarts while systemd's hardware watchdog is on to reset a Pod whose
# shutdown hangs. Otherwise it leaves the Pod running as it is.
#
# Usage: network_watchdog.sh [--dry-run]   (run as root)
# --dry-run prints the decision and its inputs and changes nothing. With it,
