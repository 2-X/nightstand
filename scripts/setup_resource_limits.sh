# Bound Nightstand's own services so they cannot starve the pod's firmware.
#
# The pod has about 1.9 GB of RAM, no swap, and earlyoom. The Eight Sleep
# firmware that runs heating and cooling shares that memory with the server,
# the sleep analysis and calibration jobs the server starts, and the
# biometrics stream. If one of ours runs away, the process that dies should
# be ours, not the firmware.
#
# OOMScoreAdjust makes the kernel and earlyoom prefer our processes as the
# victim, and the analysis jobs inherit it from the server. MemoryMax caps
# each service's cgroup where the kernel supports it; the caps sit well
# above normal use (about 190 MB for the server, 135 MB for the stream), so
# they only matter to a runaway. systemd ignores a setting it cannot apply
# rather than failing the unit.
#
# Run as root. Safe to re-run. Limits apply the next time each service starts.
#
# The server also gets a restart drop-in: restart five seconds after any
# exit and never give up. systemd's default start limit (five starts in ten
# seconds) would otherwise leave a crash-looping server stopped until the
# next reboot, and schedules and alarms run in it. StartLimitIntervalSec is
# the spelling for systemd 230 and newer, and goes under [Unit]. The older
# StartLimitInterval under [Service] covers systemd before 230, which would
# ignore the new name; newer systemd still accepts it as an alias with the
# same value.
#
# To undo: rm the three drop-ins below, then systemctl daemon-reload.
