#!/bin/bash
#
# Turns on the Pod's hardware watchdog, so a frozen kernel or PID 1 resets the
# Pod instead of leaving it with no server and no cooling. install.sh,
# update.sh and pod-installer.sh run it once they have succeeded; safe to run
# again.
#
# Background: the stock Wi-Fi driver hit a kernel oops, processes wedged in
# uninterruptible sleep, and the nightly reboot hung with PID 1 frozen.
# systemd arms its reboot watchdog only at the final reboot handoff, which
# that shutdown never reached, so nothing reset the board. RuntimeWatchdogSec
# is the layer that was missing: PID 1 pets /dev/watchdog at half the timeout.
#
# 30 seconds stays inside mtk-wdt's 31 second hardware maximum. A longer value
# depends on the kernel extending the timeout in software, and where it cannot,
# the hardware keeps its own timeout while PID 1 pets at half the longer one,
# which resets the Pod over and over.
#
# It is turned on only for the Pod 5 it was checked on: the mtk-wdt driver
# with a 31 second maximum, on a hub whose device label shows revision G53 or
# later (the rule the server uses for "Pod 5"). The first arming can reset
# the Pod, so callers run it only after they succeed. It is also left off where
# there is no watchdog device, where systemd is older than 230, where
# something else already set RuntimeWatchdogSec, where another program holds
# the device, or where the driver's timeout limits do not allow 30 seconds.
# A Pod left off for any of these reasons looks again at the next update.
#
# The first time, the setting goes in /run, which a reset clears, and stays
# there for two full timeouts before it is copied to /etc. A watchdog that
# does not take PID 1's pets therefore resets the Pod once rather than at
# every boot. The trial file in the data folder, kept after a reset or a
# failed attempt, stops it from trying again. The drop-in in /etc is the
# record of what this did: "--remove" deletes it and the trial files, and
# nothing else.
#
# Usage: setup_watchdog.sh [--remove]   (run as root)
