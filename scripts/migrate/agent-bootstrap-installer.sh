# Pod-side half of the agent bootstrap. Pushed to the target pod by
# ops/bootstrap-agent.sh and started detached, so a dropped laptop connection
# changes nothing here.
#
# This is the smaller sibling of pod-installer.sh. That tool migrates a pod
# from another fork onto this whole tree; this one adds the updater, rollback
# and revert tools to a pod running upstream free-sleep.
#
# The installer stages the overlay and keeps the previous install.
# A timed restore attempts to bring it back if installation stops.
# It does not modify Eight Sleep's firmware files. The updater it installs
# blocks the Pod's internet access after downloading updates. Schedules and
# alarms pause while the server is stopped. Recovery can still require SSH
# or a firmware reset. See ops/ANTIBRICK.md.
#
# Ordering principle, same as its sibling: everything expensive and failable
# happens BEFORE the running service is touched. By the time their service
# stops, the staged tree is already assembled and verified.
#
# Apply the overlay to a copy of the Pod's existing upstream free-sleep
# install. Preserve that source outside the files named in the manifest.
