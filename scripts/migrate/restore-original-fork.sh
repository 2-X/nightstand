# Puts a migration target's original install back exactly the way it was
# found. This is the fork-switch tool's safety net: it's copied to
# /home/dac/restore-original-fork.sh BEFORE the swap
# so it survives regardless of what state either tree ends up in, and it's
# called from two places:
#
#   1. pod-installer.sh's own failure path (attended: the installer is still
#      running and calls this directly when something goes wrong pre- or
#      post-swap).
#   2. The dead-man sentinel (unattended: a persistent systemd timer armed
#      right before the swap and disarmed right after a successful health
#      check, if the installer is killed, OOM'd, or the pod loses power
#      mid-swap, this timer fires this same script on its own within
#      minutes, with no laptop or user needed).
#
# Idempotent by design, safe to run whether the swap never happened, half
# happened, or already happened: tree moves require the installer's swap marker
# ($SWAP_MARKER exists). Restore state separates completed tree recovery from
# pending artifact restoration. Every step tolerates its target already being
# absent/undone. The marker, not the mere existence of
# $PREV, is the signal, because the pod's own updater may keep an unrelated
# rollback tree at $PREV from before we ever ran; keying off $PREV alone would
# both mistake that stale tree for the install we swapped out and wrongly undo a
# migration that already succeeded (its marker is gone). $PREV uses the same path
# update.sh/rollback_pod.sh use for "the previous tree" deliberately: on success
# this directory becomes the in-app instant-rollback slot, so the migrated pod's
# Settings page recognizes it immediately.
