// The committed definition of the agent overlay: the smallest set of files
// that turns a stock upstream install into one that can update itself, roll
// back, and revert to stock, with no other behavior change.
//
// Day zero, only self-update is live. The rollback and revert units listed
// below are files in the tree; nothing has installed them to
// /etc/systemd/system or written their sudoers rules until install.sh or
// update.sh has run once, and jobs/rollback.ts and jobs/revertToStock.ts
// just start those units. So a freshly overlaid pod can update itself, and
// the other two light up once it has.
//
// This is a server-side tooling artifact, not client code, and is not
// imported by the app bundle. ops/build-agent.sh reads it to generate the
// overlay; agentManifest.test.ts gates it.
//
// Modes:
//   add   the file is absent from stock and is copied in
//   copy  the file exists in stock and is replaced wholesale
//   patch the file exists in stock and is edited surgically, because
//         copying it would drag the rest of this tree along with it
